[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md)

A curated, **official-first** catalog of MCP servers, agent skills, AI agents, frameworks, and supporting resources for DevOps, Cloud, SRE, and Platform Engineering. It includes vendor and open-source project resources alongside a clearly labeled community-driven section.

Most agent lists stop at discovery. This one is built for operators:

- **Official-first, community-inclusive** — 80 entries organized into 15 catalog sections; official vendor and project resources are prioritized, while community-driven entries are separated in a dedicated [community section](#community-discovery-and-skills).
- **Scored, not just listed** — every entry records action capability, human-approval controls, tracing evidence, maturity, and operational risk ([how entries are scored](docs/scoring.md)).
- **Audited by CI** — GitHub repository entries are checked weekly for reachability, archived status, and stale push activity; non-GitHub documentation links are outside this automated check and require curator review.
- **Installable, not just readable** — [one command](#install-skills-into-your-coding-agent) installs hundreds of skills from cataloged Google, Microsoft, Azure, Azure DevOps, and Harness sources — plus a separate community set — into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, VS Code, or Antigravity.
- **Runnable, not just theoretical** — documented [reference-agent examples](#local-reference-agents) cover Terraform plan review, drift detection, and policy-driven container image releases.

**Safety first:** some cataloged tools and agents can change infrastructure. Prefer read-only or proposal mode, require human approval before write actions, and use least-privilege credentials — full guidance in the [safety model](docs/safety-model.md) and the practical [operator safety checklist](docs/operator-safety-checklist.md).

## Evaluation labels

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| prod | assessed as production-adjacent; not a readiness guarantee |
| prototype | assessed as a useful prototype |
| mcp | MCP/server integration |
| approval | documents an approval or safety mechanism; enforcement varies |
| evidence | has tracing/evidence/evals |
| write | write-capable; review before use |

Labels are shorthand for structured fields recorded on every entry in [data/repos.yaml](data/repos.yaml) — [how entries are scored](docs/scoring.md) explains each field and how it is verified.

## Compliance evidence checklist

Production-adjacent agent runs need a reviewable evidence packet, not just a chat transcript. Use the [compliance evidence checklist](docs/compliance-evidence.md) to capture request context, identity and data boundaries, redacted tool calls, approval records, validation output, and follow-ups for MCP servers, skills, incident copilots, Terraform reviewers, and other DevOps agents.

At minimum, record an explicit approval before any write-capable agent mutates infrastructure, source control, CI/CD, identity, secrets, incidents, or production telemetry configuration. If the approval cannot be captured, keep the agent in read-only or proposal mode.

## Operator safety checklist

Before wiring any catalog entry into cloud accounts, clusters, CI/CD, identity, secrets, databases, observability, or incident-response systems, run through the [operator safety checklist](docs/operator-safety-checklist.md). It gives teams a concrete preflight for read-only-first evaluation, domain-specific credential boundaries, no-secret-in-context handling, dry-run/proposal evidence, approval gates, blast-radius limits, and audit artifacts.

## Install skills into your coding agent

Install hundreds of [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) from the cataloged Google, Microsoft, Azure, Azure DevOps, and Harness sources with one command:

```bash
# Claude Code, macOS/Linux — installs every official skill into ~/.claude/skills/
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevOpsAIguru123/awesome-agentic-devops/main/install/claude-code/install.sh | sh -s -- --official
```

Choose breadth with a flag: `--official` (361 skills), `--community` (26), or `--all` (387). Python 3 is the only requirement — there is no `pip install` step.

Pass `--dry-run` to preview first. Commands for Cursor, Codex, VS Code, Antigravity (Mac and Windows) — plus target folders and safety notes — are in the [install guide](docs/install-skills.md). To install just one company or product, use the [official skills catalog](docs/official-skills-catalog.md) or the [community skills catalog](docs/community-skills-catalog.md).
