# Catalog schema reference

`data/repos.yaml` is the structured source of truth for the public catalog. Each entry is a top-level YAML list item with the required fields below. Keep this file and `scripts/validate_repos_yaml.py` aligned whenever a new category, artifact type, or scoring value is introduced.

## Required fields

Every catalog entry must include:

- `name` — stable display name, usually `owner/repo` for GitHub projects or a concise documentation title for hosted/vendor docs.
- `url` — absolute `https://` URL. Relative links, bare hostnames, and `http://` URLs are rejected.
- `category` — one of the allowed catalog section slugs below.
- `type` — one of the allowed artifact kinds below.
- `framework` — implementation framework or `unknown` when not applicable.
- `primary_language` — main language or content surface, such as `Go`, `Python`, `TypeScript`, `Documentation`, or `unknown`.
- `cloud_provider` — provider scope, such as `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, `multi-cloud`, `kubernetes`, or `none`.
- `use_cases` — non-empty list of concrete operator use cases.
- `action_level` — one of `read-only`, `proposal`, `write-capable`, or `unknown`.
- `human_approval` — `true`, `false`, or `unknown`.
- `evidence_tracing` — one of `yes`, `partial`, `none`, or `unknown`. Quote `"yes"` in YAML so it stays a string.
- `maturity` — one of the allowed maturity values below.
- `risk_notes` — non-empty blast-radius and credential-risk note.
- `operator_note` — non-empty reason an infrastructure operator should care.
- `labels` — non-empty list using only the README evaluation labels below.

## Catalog change decision guide

Use the smallest safe catalog change that keeps operator trust high:

1. **Refresh** an existing row when the source is still canonical but metadata,
   scoring, README wording, or safety notes are stale.
2. **Replace** a row when vendor or upstream docs point to a maintained official
   successor for a deprecated, archived, or superseded artifact.
3. **Add** a row only after verifying the source is a distinct operator-facing
   artifact with non-duplicative use cases and enough public evidence to score it.
4. **Downgrade** maturity, action level, or labels when freshness, approval,
   tracing, credential, or blast-radius signals are weaker than the current row
   claims.
5. **Remove** a row when it is unreachable, unsafe, obsolete, duplicated, or lacks
   clear operator value after checking for a current official successor.

Document the chosen path in the pull request body with the evidence worksheet
below, and keep `risk_notes`, labels, and README discovery surfaces aligned with
that decision.

## Catalog PR review checklist

Before merging a catalog change, reviewers should be able to trace every changed
row from public source evidence to README presentation and safety scoring:

- Scope: the pull request changes one coherent catalog, schema, safety, or docs
  concern rather than bundling unrelated vendor additions and tooling changes.
- Source evidence: each added, refreshed, replaced, downgraded, or removed row
  includes a reproducible evidence worksheet with canonical source, reachability,
  freshness, tool surface, credential boundary, and safety-signal notes.
- Safety scoring: `action_level`, `human_approval`, `evidence_tracing`,
  `maturity`, `risk_notes`, and labels match the most privileged documented tool
  capability, not the safest hoped-for use case.
- Discovery sync: README Recently added, catalog section tables, quick picks,
  top picks, generated sidecars, and entry counts are updated when
  `data/repos.yaml` changes.
- Secrets hygiene: PR text, screenshots, catalog metadata, and generated reports
  contain no tokens, tenant URLs, private hostnames, customer data, or copied
  production prompts.
- Verification: the PR records the local commands run, including schema
  validation, tests, README count checks, sidecar sync when available, and
  whitespace checks.

## Identity and duplicate rules

Catalog identity is intentionally strict so generated README tables, audits, and
review discussions can point to a single stable row:

- `name` must be unique across the whole flat list. Prefer `owner/repo` for
  GitHub-backed projects so the display name stays stable even if the README
  section changes.
- `url` must be unique across the whole flat list and must be the canonical
  operator-facing source for the artifact being cataloged.
- Do not add a second row for the same artifact only to represent another use
  case or README section. Capture additional operator use cases in `use_cases`
  and choose the best single `category`.
- Separate documentation and runnable surfaces may have distinct rows only when
  they are genuinely different artifacts, such as vendor docs plus a separate
  installable `mcp-server` repository.

## README synchronization rules

When `data/repos.yaml` changes, update every README surface that helps operators
discover or verify the row. At minimum, run `python3 scripts/sync_readme_counts.py`
so the intro count stays aligned with the YAML source of truth. For new catalog
entries, also update these README sections in the same pull request:

- `## Recently added` — prepend a dated row for the new or refreshed entry.
- The matching catalog section table for the entry's `category`.
- The intro quick-pick table when the category already has a representative row.
- `## Top picks by use case` only when the entry is genuinely a top recommendation
  for that operator workflow; do not add weak entries just to fill the table.

Run `python3 scripts/sync_readme_counts.py --check` before review so README count
drift fails locally rather than in CI.

## Allowed categories

Category slugs define the curated README sections and are validated in CI. The prefix is also a provenance signal:

- `official-*` categories are for first-party vendor, CNCF/Kubernetes SIG, foundation, or upstream project-governed sources where maintainership is clear from the repository owner or official documentation.
- `community-*` categories are for useful third-party tools, discovery lists, or skill collections that are not governed by the vendor/project whose platform they operate.

Do not classify a repo as official just because it integrates with an official API, appears in a third-party list, or uses a vendor name. When provenance is unclear, prefer a community category or hold the entry until a first-party source confirms ownership.

- `community-agent-skills`
- `community-discovery`
- `community-mcp-servers`
- `official-agent-frameworks`
- `official-agent-security-tools`
- `official-agent-skills`
- `official-browser-automation-mcp-servers`
- `official-ci-cd-mcp-servers`
- `official-cloud-agent-toolkits`
- `official-cloud-mcp-servers`
- `official-cloud-security-mcp-servers`
- `official-cloudops-agent-samples`
- `official-data-platform-mcp-servers`
- `official-devops-mcp-platforms`
- `official-devops-mcp-servers`
- `official-diagramming-mcp-tools`
- `official-finops-mcp-servers`
- `official-gitops-mcp-servers`
- `official-iac-mcp-servers`
- `official-mcp-reference-implementations`
- `official-mcp-registry`
- `official-mcp-sdks`
- `official-platform-agent-toolkits`
- `official-security-mcp-servers`
- `official-sre-mcp-servers`

Add a new category only when the existing taxonomy cannot describe the entry clearly, and update all of these together:

1. `scripts/validate_repos_yaml.py`
2. `tests/test_repos_yaml.py`
3. `README.md` catalog section and quick-pick references when applicable
4. This schema reference

## Allowed artifact types

Use the narrowest type that describes the actual operator surface:

- `agent-framework`
- `agent-plugin`
- `agent-security-scanner`
- `agent-template`
- `agent-toolkit`
- `curated-list`
- `documentation`
- `hosted-mcp-server`
- `mcp-operator`
- `mcp-plugin`
- `mcp-registry`
- `mcp-server`
- `mcp-server-catalog`
- `mcp-server-collection`
- `mcp-server-plugin`
- `reference-architecture`
- `reference-implementations`
- `registry`
- `sdk`
- `security-guidance`
- `security-tool`
- `skill`
- `skill-library`

Docs pages and runnable servers are distinct artifacts. A vendor may have both a `documentation` entry and a separate `mcp-server` or `hosted-mcp-server` entry when both are useful to operators.

## Minimal entry template

Start new entries from this shape, then replace every placeholder with verified
facts from the official repository or documentation. `data/repos.yaml` is a flat
list, so add this as a new top-level list item rather than nesting it under a
category key.

```yaml
- name: owner/repo-or-doc-name
  url: https://example.com/official-source
  category: official-devops-mcp-servers
  type: mcp-server
  framework: unknown
  primary_language: unknown
  cloud_provider: none
  use_cases:
    - Short operator task this tool supports
  action_level: read-only
  human_approval: unknown
  evidence_tracing: unknown
  maturity: production-adjacent
  risk_notes: Verify credential scope, write tools, telemetry, and audit behavior before production-adjacent use.
  operator_note: Explain why a DevOps, SRE, platform, cloud, security, or MLOps operator should evaluate it.
  labels:
    - mcp
```

Template review checklist:

- Replace placeholder `unknown` values whenever official docs expose a more
  specific framework, language, credential, approval, or tracing signal.
- Use `action_level: proposal` for dry-run or plan-generating tools, and
  `action_level: write-capable` plus the `write` label when any tool can mutate
  infrastructure, code, tickets, cloud resources, or production data.
- Prefer read-only, scoped, or test credentials in `risk_notes`; do not paste
  secrets, tokens, customer data, or private endpoints into catalog metadata.
- Add `approval` only with `human_approval: true`, and add `evidence` only when
  official docs or code show audit logs, traces, citations, run artifacts, or
  similarly durable evidence.

## Source verification checklist

Before adding or refreshing a catalog row, collect harmless public evidence for
the operator-facing surface rather than relying on marketing copy or a broad MCP
index. A reviewer should be able to reproduce these checks without secrets:

- Reachability: confirm the repository or documentation URL returns successfully
  and is the canonical upstream, vendor, foundation, or community project page.
- Freshness: for GitHub projects, check that the repository is not archived and
  has recent enough activity for the maturity claim; otherwise explain the stale
  or archival signal in `risk_notes`.
- Tool surface: verify whether the artifact is a runnable `mcp-server`, a hosted
  endpoint, an SDK, documentation, a skill, or only a curated list, then set
  `type` to the narrowest matching value.
- Credential boundary: identify the least-privilege credential mode an operator
  can use for evaluation, or state clearly when the project only documents broad
  credentials or leaves credential scope unspecified.
- Safety signals: map observed dry-run behavior, approval gates, evidence or
  audit artifacts, telemetry, and write capability back to `action_level`,
  `human_approval`, `evidence_tracing`, `risk_notes`, and `labels`.

### Evaluation environment boundary guidance

Catalog review should start in a disposable environment that cannot mutate or
expose production systems. Before treating an agent, MCP server, or toolkit as
production-adjacent, verify and document the evaluation boundary:

- Use sandbox cloud projects, test tenants, fixture repositories, disposable
  issue trackers, demo clusters, or read-only workspaces before connecting real
  infrastructure.
- Prefer read-only credentials and narrow OAuth scopes first; move to scoped
  write credentials only when a documented dry-run, preview, or approval flow has
  already been inspected.
- Keep network egress, webhook targets, CI/CD triggers, and external API access
  limited to test systems while validating tool behavior.
- Confirm logs, traces, exported reports, and screenshots are redacted and public
  safe before referencing them in `risk_notes`, README rows, or pull request
  evidence.
- If a tool cannot be evaluated safely without production credentials or customer
  data, do not raise its maturity score; record the evaluation blocker in
  `risk_notes` instead.

### Runtime isolation boundary guidance

Catalog reviewers should also verify where the agent or MCP server executes. A
safe credential story is not enough when the runtime can see the operator's host,
cluster, browser session, or CI runner filesystem:

- Prefer local sandboxes, disposable containers, ephemeral CI runners, dev
  clusters, or test workstations before running an agent on laptops or shared
  runners that contain production credentials.
- Check whether the tool needs host filesystem mounts, shell access, Docker
  socket access, kubeconfig contexts, browser profiles, SSH agents, package
  managers, or cloud CLIs that can inherit ambient credentials.
- Limit outbound network egress and webhook callbacks to known test endpoints
  while evaluating tools that can execute commands, fetch plugins, open browser
  sessions, or call external APIs.
- Treat missing sandboxing, namespace, filesystem, process, or egress controls as
  maturity blockers for write-capable artifacts; name the runtime boundary in
  `risk_notes` instead of assuming the host environment is safe.
- Capture evidence with synthetic fixture repositories, demo clusters, and public
  test data only; do not publish local paths, usernames, private runner labels,
  kubeconfig context names, or internal hostnames.

### Hosted MCP credential boundary guidance

Hosted MCP servers deserve extra credential scrutiny because the runnable surface
is remote and may proxy operator data through a vendor-controlled endpoint. Before
cataloging a `hosted-mcp-server`, verify and document:

- Authentication mode: OAuth, API key, bearer token, SSO, unauthenticated public
  endpoint, or unknown. Prefer OAuth or scoped tokens over long-lived broad keys.
- Scope boundary: read-only endpoint, documented OAuth scopes, project or tenant
  scoping, sandbox workspace, or unknown scope. If only broad account access is
  documented, say so in `risk_notes`.
- Data handling: whether prompts, tool arguments, logs, traces, or retrieved
  records leave the operator's environment, and whether vendor docs describe
  retention, audit logs, or telemetry controls.
- Evaluation guardrail: start with disposable workspaces, test tenants, or
  read-only scopes, and never paste tokens, customer data, tenant URLs, or private
  hostnames into `data/repos.yaml`, README rows, screenshots, or PR comments.

For hosted endpoints that expose both read-only and write-capable tool groups,
score the row by the most privileged documented capability unless the catalog row
explicitly points to a separate read-only endpoint or mode.

### Tool permission and consent boundary guidance

Agent and MCP catalog rows should reflect the permissions an operator must grant
before the artifact can act, not just the friendly demo path. During review,
inspect the documented tool list, manifest, CLI flags, or host configuration and
record how consent is enforced:

- Identify the default permission posture: disabled until explicitly enabled,
  read-only by default, allowlisted per tool, or broadly enabled once connected.
- Check whether destructive tools such as deploy, delete, merge, rotate, trigger,
  remediate, or shell execution can be separated from lookup and planning tools.
- Prefer entries that support per-tool allowlists, scoped runner identities,
  workspace or namespace boundaries, and revocable OAuth scopes or tokens.
- Treat "user can review output" as weaker than an enforced approval gate; only
  set `human_approval: true` when the tool or host blocks mutation until explicit
  operator consent is recorded.
- Note missing permission separation, broad host access, or undocumented consent
  behavior in `risk_notes`, and score by the most privileged tool exposed by the
  configured artifact.

### Approval evidence and change-control guidance

For write-capable agents and MCP servers, `human_approval: true` should mean an
operator can verify who approved which action, against which target, and with what
rollback or change-control context. Before giving approval credit, inspect whether
the artifact or host workflow documents durable approval evidence:

- Identify the approval surface: pull request review, chat approval, ticket state,
  deployment environment gate, policy decision, signed plan, or explicit CLI/UI
  confirmation.
- Check that approval records include actor identity, timestamp, requested action,
  target environment or resource, diff/plan or command summary, and outcome.
- Prefer workflows that bind approvals to scoped test repositories, sandbox
  projects, change tickets, or deployment environments instead of broad one-time
  consent for future writes.
- Treat break-glass or auto-approval modes as production risks; mention required
  compensating controls such as post-change audit review, rollback plan, or
  limited-duration access in `risk_notes`.
- Do not mark `approval` or `evidence` labels solely because a demo asks the user
  to press enter; require a durable review artifact, audit log, ticket, or run
  record that can be inspected after the action.

### Incident automation and escalation guidance

Incident, on-call, and runbook agents can page people, silence alerts, modify
incident state, run remediation commands, or publish stakeholder updates. Score
these rows by the operational blast radius of their most privileged documented
workflow:

- Separate notification, summarization, and read-only timeline tools from actions
  that acknowledge, silence, escalate, reassign, resolve, or trigger remediation.
- Prefer dry-run runbooks, proposed remediation steps, test services, demo alerts,
  and sandbox incident rooms before granting access to live on-call rotations or
  production paging policies.
- Check whether escalation changes and alert silences capture actor identity,
  incident ID, service or environment, duration, reason, rollback path, and audit
  evidence.
- Treat auto-remediation, bulk alert suppression, broad paging-policy access, or
  undocumented escalation controls as write-capable production risks and call them
  out in `risk_notes`.
- Keep incident examples public-safe: use synthetic incidents, fixture alerts,
  redacted timelines, and placeholders such as `<test-service>` instead of real
  outage details, customer impact, phone numbers, or private escalation targets.

### Compliance evidence and audit export guidance

Compliance, GRC, and audit-assistance agents can collect policy evidence, inspect
control status, open remediation tickets, or export reports that may expose
regulated environment details. Score these rows by the evidence and control data
they can access or change:

- Verify the artifact documents which compliance frameworks, controls, evidence
  stores, tickets, cloud accounts, repositories, or identity systems it can read
  before treating it as production-adjacent.
- Separate evidence collection and gap summaries from actions that change control
  status, approve exceptions, create attestations, assign findings, or trigger
  remediation workflows.
- Prefer sandbox frameworks, fixture evidence folders, demo cloud accounts,
  read-only audit exports, and redacted reports before connecting real compliance
  workspaces or customer environments.
- Check whether exported evidence includes actor identity, source system, control
  ID, resource scope, timestamp, hash or version, retention boundary, and audit
  trail so `evidence_tracing` claims are reproducible.
- Keep compliance examples public-safe: use synthetic controls, placeholder
  auditor names, `<test-control>`, `<sandbox-audit-export>`, and redacted finding
  IDs instead of customer evidence, private policies, legal opinions, or regulated
  data.

### Data platform operations and data movement guidance

Data platform agents and MCP servers may inspect schemas, query production data,
move records between systems, update pipelines, or expose warehouse metadata.
Score these rows by the most sensitive dataset or mutation path they can reach:

- Separate metadata discovery, lineage lookup, and read-only query helpers from
  tools that run writes, backfills, deletes, schema migrations, access grants, or
  pipeline triggers.
- Prefer sample databases, masked datasets, test warehouses, read-only roles, and
  narrow project or dataset scopes before granting access to production
  warehouses, queues, buckets, or streaming topics.
- Check whether query logs, exported rows, embeddings, lineage graphs, and cached
  results can contain PII, secrets, customer data, or regulated records, then
  document masking, retention, and deletion boundaries in `risk_notes`.
- Verify whether data mutations capture actor identity, query or job ID, dataset
  and table scope, row-count or partition impact, timestamp, rollback plan, and
  audit evidence before using `approval` or `evidence` labels.
- Keep data examples public-safe: use fixture schemas, synthetic rows,
  `<sample-dataset>`, `<test-warehouse>`, and redacted query plans instead of real
  table names, customer identifiers, exported records, or private lineage graphs.

### Cost, quota, and FinOps impact guidance

Cost and FinOps agents may estimate spend, inspect invoices, change budgets,
trigger optimization actions, or resize infrastructure. Score these rows by the
highest-cost action or financial data surface they can reach:

- Separate read-only billing lookup, forecast summaries, and recommendation
  generation from actions that change budgets, reservations, quotas, instance
  sizes, autoscaling policy, storage class, retention, or resource lifecycle.
- Prefer sandbox billing exports, read-only cost explorer roles, limited accounts,
  fixture usage data, and explicit budget thresholds before connecting production
  cloud organizations, chargeback systems, or procurement workflows.
- Check whether cost reports, invoices, tags, account names, project IDs, and usage
  exports can reveal customer, revenue, contract, or business-sensitive data;
  document masking, retention, and access boundaries in `risk_notes`.
- Verify whether optimization actions capture actor identity, account or project
  scope, resource IDs, estimated savings, performance or availability tradeoffs,
  rollback plan, timestamp, and audit evidence before using `approval` or
  `evidence` labels.
- Keep examples public-safe: use `<sandbox-billing-export>`, `<test-budget>`,
  `<fixture-usage-report>`, synthetic account names, and redacted cost figures
  instead of real invoices, account IDs, customer names, or contract terms.

### MLOps model operation and evaluation guidance

MLOps agents and MCP servers may inspect experiments, fine-tune models, deploy
endpoints, change feature pipelines, or export evaluation artifacts. Score these
rows by the most privileged model, data, or deployment workflow they document:

- Separate read-only experiment lookup, model-card summarization, and evaluation
  report generation from actions that start training jobs, register models,
  approve promotions, deploy endpoints, update feature stores, or trigger batch
  inference.
- Prefer toy datasets, masked evaluation sets, sandbox model registries, test
  inference endpoints, and read-only tracking credentials before connecting
  production training clusters, registries, feature stores, or customer prompts.
- Check whether prompts, labels, embeddings, model outputs, checkpoints,
  fine-tuning datasets, and eval traces can expose PII, secrets, licensed data, or
  unreleased model behavior; document retention, deletion, export, and redaction
  boundaries in `risk_notes`.
- Verify whether model promotions, endpoint deployments, feature-pipeline writes,
  and training runs capture actor identity, model or run ID, dataset version,
  evaluation threshold, rollback path, timestamp, and audit evidence before using
  `approval` or `evidence` labels.
- Keep MLOps examples public-safe: use `<toy-dataset>`, `<sandbox-model-registry>`,
  `<test-endpoint>`, synthetic prompts, and redacted scorecards instead of real
  customer data, proprietary checkpoints, private model names, or production eval
  logs.

### Secrets and identity operations guidance

Secrets managers, identity platforms, and access-review agents can expose or
change some of the highest-impact credentials in an operator environment. Score
these rows by the most privileged secret, principal, or policy workflow they can
reach:

- Separate read-only lookup, inventory, posture summaries, and access-review
  recommendations from actions that create, rotate, revoke, delete, reveal, or
  grant secrets, keys, tokens, users, groups, roles, policies, and bindings.
- Prefer sandbox vaults, test directories, read-only identity scopes, short-lived
  credentials, and fixture principals before connecting production secrets
  stores, SSO tenants, cloud IAM, Kubernetes service accounts, or CI/CD secrets.
- Check whether command output, traces, screenshots, reports, and model context
  can contain secret values, token metadata, principal names, group membership,
  policy documents, or access paths; document redaction, masking, retention, and
  audit boundaries in `risk_notes`.
- Verify whether identity or secret mutations capture actor identity, target
  principal or secret path, policy diff, reason, ticket/change ID, timestamp,
  expiration, rollback or revocation path, and audit evidence before using
  `approval` or `evidence` labels.
- Keep examples public-safe: use `<test-principal>`, `<sandbox-vault>`,
  `<fixture-secret-path>`, redacted policy snippets, and synthetic access-review
  findings instead of real usernames, tenant IDs, vault paths, token prefixes, or
  production IAM policies.

### Credential lifecycle and revocation guidance

Catalog reviewers should check not only which credentials an artifact needs, but
also how safely those credentials can be issued, rotated, revoked, and audited
after evaluation. Before raising maturity for an agent, MCP server, or toolkit,
look for lifecycle controls that keep abandoned experiments from becoming
long-lived production access paths:

- Prefer OAuth apps, short-lived tokens, workload identity, or scoped service
  accounts over shared personal access tokens and static cloud keys.
- Verify that setup docs describe how to rotate or revoke credentials, remove
  installed apps, disable webhooks, and disconnect CI/CD or chat integrations.
- Check whether credential use is attributable to a bot, service account,
  workspace, project, tenant, repository, or environment rather than a broad
  human administrator identity.
- Treat missing revocation, rotation, expiration, or audit guidance as a safety
  gap in `risk_notes`, especially for write-capable tools and hosted MCP servers.
- Do not catalog example credential values, tenant-specific callback URLs, app
  client secrets, or private installation IDs; describe the public lifecycle
  control instead.

### Telemetry and retention boundary guidance

Agents and MCP servers often observe prompts, tool arguments, command output,
repository contents, cloud inventory, tickets, traces, and incident notes. Before
raising maturity or evidence scores, verify where that data can flow:

- Identify whether telemetry, analytics, hosted logs, traces, prompt capture,
  crash reports, or model-evaluation uploads are enabled by default, opt-in,
  opt-out, self-hosted, or undocumented.
- Check documented retention, deletion, export, tenant-isolation, and regional
  processing controls before treating vendor-hosted evidence as production safe.
- Prefer projects that let operators disable telemetry, redact sensitive fields,
  keep logs local, or route audit evidence to operator-controlled storage.
- Treat command output, infrastructure inventories, stack traces, and ticket text
  as potentially sensitive even when credentials are redacted.
- Record unknown retention, broad vendor-side logging, missing redaction controls,
  or unclear data residency in `risk_notes`; do not use `evidence` labels for
  telemetry-only signals unless the evidence is durable, reviewable, and safe to
  share.

### Dependency and supply-chain boundary guidance

Agent toolkits and MCP servers often ask operators to install packages, container
images, browser extensions, CI actions, plugins, or generated code before a tool
can run. Review the install path as part of safety scoring, not as a separate
afterthought:

- Prefer artifacts that are published from official package registries,
  first-party container registries, signed releases, or reproducible source builds
  with clear version tags.
- Check whether setup requires curl-to-shell installers, privileged Docker socket
  access, host filesystem mounts, broad CI secrets, or dynamically downloaded
  plugins, and call out those risks in `risk_notes`.
- Pin versions for evaluation where possible, record the inspected release or
  commit in PR evidence, and avoid cataloging instructions that require running
  unpinned install scripts against production workstations or runners.
- Treat generated code, third-party plugins, and transitive tool downloads as
  untrusted until reviewed; evaluate them in disposable environments before
  granting repository, cloud, cluster, or identity permissions.
- Do not raise maturity solely because a project has many stars or package
  downloads; use provenance, release freshness, least-privilege install docs,
  signing or checksum signals, and safe rollback/uninstall guidance.

### Public-safe metadata rules

Catalog metadata, README rows, screenshots, generated reports, and pull request
notes must be safe to publish. Treat every catalog review as public by default:

- Do not include API tokens, OAuth refresh tokens, bearer tokens, service-account
  keys, kubeconfigs, SSH keys, webhook secrets, session cookies, or one-time auth
  codes.
- Do not paste customer data, production prompts, tenant-specific URLs, private
  hostnames, internal repository paths, account IDs, project IDs, cluster names,
  database names, or log snippets that could identify a real environment.
- Use generic placeholders such as `<scoped-test-token>`, `<sandbox-project>`,
  `<test-tenant>`, or `<read-only-workspace>` when explaining credential or
  environment boundaries.
- If source evidence requires a private console, API response, or screenshot,
  summarize the public documentation claim instead and keep private evidence out
  of the catalog PR.
- When a tool's safety posture depends on secret scanning or redaction features,
  mention the documented control in `risk_notes` without copying example secrets
  or live configuration values.

### Agent instruction-boundary review

DevOps agents and MCP servers can surface untrusted text from repositories,
issues, run logs, cloud resources, tickets, dashboards, database rows, and web
pages. Catalog reviewers should check whether a tool documents prompt-injection or
tool-output trust-boundary controls before marking it production-adjacent:

- Treat remote content, README snippets, generated plans, command output, logs,
  incident notes, and third-party MCP registry metadata as data, not executable
  instructions for the reviewing agent.
- Prefer tools that separate system/developer instructions from retrieved context,
  quote or cite external evidence, and avoid automatically following instructions
  embedded in tool results, comments, or logs.
- For write-capable agents, require dry-run/proposal mode and explicit human
  approval before applying changes derived from untrusted content.
- Note missing instruction-boundary, sandboxing, allowlist, or confirmation
  behavior in `risk_notes` rather than assuming the host agent will contain the
  risk.
- Keep any prompt-injection examples synthetic and public-safe; do not paste real
  production prompts, incident transcripts, customer tickets, or sensitive logs
  into catalog metadata or PR evidence.

### Safety-score evidence rules

Safety scores must be backed by the tool surface you inspected, not by broad
category assumptions or marketing language. Use conservative values when the
source is unclear:

- Set `action_level: read-only` only when the documented tools expose lookup,
  search, describe, or export behavior without mutation; set `proposal` when the
  artifact produces plans, diffs, previews, or recommendations that require a
  separate apply step.
- Set `action_level: write-capable` whenever any documented tool can create,
  update, delete, trigger, deploy, merge, rotate, acknowledge, remediate, or run
  commands against source control, cloud resources, clusters, CI/CD, identity,
  secrets, databases, observability, or incident systems.
- Set `human_approval: true` only when official docs, code, or examples show an
  explicit approval gate before the write-capable operation. A general statement
  that operators should review output is not enough.
- Set `evidence_tracing: "yes"` or `partial` only when the source documents
  durable traces such as audit logs, citations, run artifacts, change records,
  request IDs, or exported reports. If evidence is not documented, use `unknown`
  or `none` and explain the gap in `risk_notes`.
- Keep labels synchronized with these structured fields: `write` for
  write-capable tools, `approval` for explicit approval gates, and `evidence` for
  documented tracing or audit artifacts.

### External index and evaluation signals

Broad MCP indexes, registry mirrors, popularity dashboards, and third-party
evaluation scorecards are useful discovery inputs, but they are not catalog
acceptance evidence by themselves. Treat external signals as review prompts:

- Use external indexes to find candidates, duplicates, aliases, or missing
  official documentation, then verify every catalog claim against first-party
  vendor, foundation, CNCF/Kubernetes SIG, or upstream project sources before
  editing `data/repos.yaml`.
- Keep imported rankings, popularity metrics, automated evaluations, and broad
  MCP index scores in generated sidecars or review notes rather than copying
  them into safety-scored catalog fields.
- Do not let third-party scores override the local rubric for `action_level`,
  `human_approval`, `evidence_tracing`, `maturity`, `risk_notes`, or labels.
- When external sources disagree with first-party docs, document the conflict in
  the pull request evidence worksheet and prefer the canonical upstream source
  for catalog metadata.

### Risk notes writing guide

Write `risk_notes` as a short operator warning, not a marketing summary. Good
risk notes answer what could go wrong during evaluation and what guardrail should
be used first:

- Name the credential boundary: read-only token, scoped test account, sandbox
  cloud project, limited Kubernetes namespace, or unknown scope.
- Identify write capability, destructive actions, external API calls, telemetry,
  or data exfiltration paths when the tool can reach infrastructure or sensitive
  systems.
- Prefer dry-run, proposal, preview, or plan-only workflows before write-capable
  execution, and mention required human approval when official docs or code show
  an approval gate.
- Call out missing evidence honestly: use `unknown` scoring or note when audit
  logs, traces, citations, or run artifacts are not documented.

Example:

```yaml
risk_notes: Use a read-only GitHub token for evaluation; write-capable issue and pull-request tools require scoped test repositories, explicit approval, and audit-log review before production use.
```

### Automated GitHub freshness audit

For substantial catalog edits, run the lightweight GitHub metadata audit before
review so stale or unreachable repositories are visible next to the proposed
metadata change:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_github_repos.py --stale-days 365
```

The command writes `reports/github-repo-audit.json` and
`reports/github-repo-audit.md` with reachability, archived/private status,
primary-language drift, last push time, and stale-repository warnings for GitHub
URLs in `data/repos.yaml`. Treat the reports as curator evidence, not generated
catalog source: summarize relevant warnings in the pull request body, update
`risk_notes` when an entry is stale or archived, and do not commit the reports
unless a reviewer explicitly asks for a point-in-time audit artifact.

For non-GitHub documentation and hosted MCP endpoints, record a separate manual
reachability check because the GitHub audit intentionally skips those URLs.

### Deprecation and removal handling

When a cataloged project becomes archived, deprecated, unreachable, or materially
less safe than its current score suggests, prefer a traceable refresh over a
silent delete:

- Replace the row with the current official successor when vendor or upstream
  documentation points to a maintained repository, hosted endpoint, or docs page.
- Keep a stale row only when it still has operator value, lower the maturity or
  action score as needed, and explain the archived, deprecated, or unsupported
  status in `risk_notes`.
- Remove a row when the source is unreachable, unsafe, abandoned without clear
  operator value, or superseded by a better canonical entry; mention the removal
  in `CHANGELOG.md` unless it is part of routine duplicate cleanup.
- Never preserve an obsolete entry just to maintain README counts. Run
  `python3 scripts/sync_readme_counts.py` after removals or replacements.

### Evidence capture worksheet

Paste a short evidence note into the pull request body when catalog metadata
changes. Keep it factual, reproducible, and free of secrets:

```markdown
Source evidence:
- Canonical source: <official repository or vendor docs URL>
- Reachability check: <command or URL check used, with date>
- Freshness signal: <GitHub pushedAt/not archived, docs date, or documented caveat>
- Tool surface: <mcp-server | hosted endpoint | sdk | docs | skill | list>
- Credential boundary: <read-only token, scoped test credential, OAuth scope, or unknown>
- Safety signals: <dry-run/proposal mode, approval gate, tracing/audit artifact, write capability>
```

Suggested harmless commands for GitHub-backed entries:

```bash
gh repo view OWNER/REPO --json nameWithOwner,isArchived,pushedAt,defaultBranchRef,licenseInfo,url,repositoryTopics
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/README.md --jq .download_url
```

For non-GitHub documentation, record the canonical URL, HTTP status, redirected
URL if any, and content type. Do not include access tokens, private tenant URLs,
internal hostnames, customer data, or screenshots that expose credentials.

## Maturity values

- `production-adjacent` — official or mature enough to evaluate near production, but not a production-readiness guarantee.
- `active-oss` — active open-source project with useful operator value.
- `prototype` — useful but early, experimental, or lower-confidence.
- `curated-list` — index or registry rather than a runnable tool.
- `skill-library` — installable agent-skill collection.
- `unknown` — insufficient evidence; prefer avoiding this for new entries unless the operator value is clear.

## Evaluation labels and consistency rules

Labels are the README-facing shorthand for structured safety fields:

- `prod` — production-adjacent maturity.
- `prototype` — prototype maturity.
- `mcp` — MCP/server integration.
- `approval` — `human_approval: true`.
- `evidence` — `evidence_tracing: "yes"` or `partial`.
- `write` — `action_level: write-capable`.

Validator-enforced invariants:

- `write` requires `action_level: write-capable`, and write-capable entries must include `write`.
- `approval` requires `human_approval: true`, and human-approval entries must include `approval`.
- `evidence_tracing: "yes"` requires `evidence`; `evidence` cannot be used with `none` or `unknown`.
- `prod` and `prototype` are mutually exclusive.
- `maturity: prototype` requires `prototype` and cannot use `prod`.

## Pre-submit commands

Run these before opening a catalog PR:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_readme_counts.py
python3 scripts/sync_catalog_json.py
python3 scripts/validate_repos_yaml.py
python3 -m pytest -q
git diff --check
```

If `pytest` is unavailable, create a local virtual environment and install dev dependencies first:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```
